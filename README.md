PhorumLedge

This project is building a technology to scrap web forums and extract information from them.
Actually is at a very first stage of development.

Watch this project in LandsScape: https://landscape.io/github/javierj/LaPISK

Using:
 * Behave for BDD
 * Expects for asserting the Behave's test cases
 * Pymongo for accessing MongoDB
 * BeautifulSoup4 for scratching HTML
 * Flask for web GUI.
 
 And:
  * Travis CI for executing test cases when uploading a commit
  * Landscape for measuring code quality
( both are amazing tools. Test it !)
